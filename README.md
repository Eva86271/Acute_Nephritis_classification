# Acute_Nephritis_classification
## Overview:
The main idea of this data set is to prepare the algorithm of the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. It will be the example of diagnosing of the acute inflammations of urinary bladder and acute nephritises. For better understanding of the problem let us consider definitions of both
diseases given by medics. Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and
the urination in form of constant urine pushing, micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping. 

Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at men. It begins with sudden fever, which reaches, and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains, which are sometimes very strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not
infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen.The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system, which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system. The prediction model was made from Decision Tree Algorithm after Data Exploration.

## Model Overview:
The model was selected as Decision Tree Algorithm it is an robust algorithm when coming to data which are mix of categorical and numerical data.
